100% renewable electricity in 2050? Philippe Quirion's analysis
---

by Elisa Escanez and SÃ©bastien Castets.

**Goal**: analysis of the EOLES model of P. Quirion which aims to determine whether a 100% renewable energy power mix is viable in France in 2050. 

This repository implements a [simplified Eoles model](SimplifiedModel.py)  and the [full Eoles model](EolesModel.py). The simulations are executed in a [Jupyter Notebook](EolesModelSimulation.ipynb) .

This project is part of a 5th year project at INSA Toulouse tutored by Aude Rondepierre and Charles Dossal.
